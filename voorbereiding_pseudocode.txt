START

1. Define a list to store data for devices, each containing:
   - Device name
   - Sum of values
   - Minimum value
   - Maximum value
   - Count of values

2. Read existing data from 'output.txt':
   - For each line, extract the device name and value.
   - Update the device data (sum, min, max, count).

3. Connect to the MQTT server with the following settings:
   - Server address
   - Client ID
   - Keep-alive interval and clean session enabled.
   - Set callbacks for:
     - Connection lost: Log the cause.
     - Message received: Process the message.
     - Message delivery confirmation: Log confirmation.

4. Subscribe to the specified MQTT topic.

5. When a message is received:
   - Parse the message to extract the device name and value.
   - Append the message to 'output.txt'.
   - Check if the device exists in the list:
     - If yes, update its sum, min, max, and count.
     - If no, add it to the list with initial values.
   - Display the updated data for all devices.

6. Wait for user input in a loop:
   - If the user enters 'Q' or 'q', exit the loop.

7. Disconnect from the MQTT server.

8. Display the final overall statistics:
   - Global minimum, maximum, and average across all devices.
